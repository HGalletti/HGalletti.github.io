## Projects

### Smart Electoral Assistant

Smart Electoral Assistant: https://github.com/HGalletti/Asistente_electoral - ElectoAI is an AI-powered app using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer legal and operational questions about the 2025 Buenos Aires (CABA) elections.
Some older personal projects (2022–2023)

I'm currently working on adding more recent and real-world projects.

## Some personal and older projects (Kaggle-based, 2022-2023)

These projects were developed as part of exploratory work and training, based on publicly available datasets from Kaggle. They involved full machine learning pipelines—from data exploration to model evaluation—and served as a foundation for further professional work in data science and machine learning.

### [SBA guaranted loans](https://github.com/HGalletti/SBA-Guaranteed-Loans/blob/main/Pr%C3%A9stamos%20garantizados%20por%20la%20SBA.pdf)

#### Project Introduction

In the realm of small business financing in the United States, the mission of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has been pivotal since its establishment in 1953. By promoting and supporting small enterprises within the U.S. credit market, the SBA has played a crucial role in fostering job creation and reducing unemployment.

One of the SBA's key initiatives is its loan guarantee program, designed to incentivize banks to extend loans to small businesses. Acting as an insurance provider, the SBA mitigates the risk for banks by guaranteeing a portion of the loan amount. In the event of a loan default, the SBA steps in to cover the guaranteed portion.

Despite SBA loans guaranteeing only a portion of the loan balance, banks still face the dilemma of whether to grant such loans, given the risk of default. Analyzing historical data becomes a valuable tool for informed decision-making in this context.

#### Project Objective

The primary business challenge is to determine if a loan can be granted with reasonable confidence that the borrowing company will repay it without significant issues.

#### Key Business Questions

- What defines companies that best predict loan repayment or potential problems?
- Does a company's history of multiple loans impact the likelihood of encountering repayment issues?
- How do the lending bank and credit line influence loan repayment?
- Is there a correlation between the loan term, the year the loan was issued, and repayment success?

#### Analytical Approach

Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a company may face difficulties in loan repayment, simplistically referred to as a "defaulted loan." This data science project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and is developed using technical tools like Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and more.

### [Breast Cancer Detection](https://github.com/HGalletti/CancerDetection/)

#### Project Introduction

Breast cancer is a global health concern affecting millions of individuals every year. It's the second most common cancer in the world and poses a significant threat to women's health. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.

#### Project Objective

The primary objective of this data science project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect breast cancer based on parameters extracted from digitized images of breast masses. By analyzing these images, we aim to predict whether a mass is malignant or benign.

#### Key Business Questions

- What are the defining characteristics of tumors that best predict malignancy?
- How can machine learning assist medical professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses?
- What are the potential benefits and limitations of using automated image analysis in cancer detection?
- How can this technology contribute to early detection and improved treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients?

#### Analytical Approach

Our approach involves utilizing a diverse set of machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbor, support vector machines, and a neural network. These models analyze features extracted from digitized images of breast masses. We employ Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other tools for data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
